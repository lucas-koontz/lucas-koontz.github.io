Hello, World!

I'm Lucas Koontz, a Software Engineer with a passion for technology and coding, with over 6 years of experience in software development. Yet, that is a very simplistic description. You could describe me as being a reliable friend, a collaborative team player, and an avid coffee drinker, but I promise my layers aren't being given their due.

This is my personal blog (duh). You will be able to found more about myself, personal projects, cheat sheets, other things useful information that have helped me.

Keep an eye out for my next posts.

Cheers! :smile:
